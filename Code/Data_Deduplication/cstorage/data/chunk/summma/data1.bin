 using Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) calculation 
 
Step 5: Each chunk file apply pre-prcess for File Tokenization,Binary Conversion and Compute words weight(TF-IDF)
 
Step 6: next implement Hash Computation for Decimal value using SHA-3.If hashes true duplicate file occur its not store else store the file into 	cloud storage

Step 7:we can reduce the data access time and retrieval is made easier for the data enquired. The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm decides whether a bl
